# Authentication & RBAC Testing Guide

## 🎯 **100% Completion Achieved!**

The authentication and role-based access control implementation is now complete with all security measures in place.

## ✅ **What's Been Implemented:**

### 1. **JWT Authentication** ✅
- ✅ JWT token generation with user ID and role
- ✅ Password hashing with bcryptjs
- ✅ Token expiration (1 hour)
- ✅ Input validation for email and password

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ✅
- ✅ Backend middleware for authentication (`verifyToken`)
- ✅ Backend middleware for admin-only access (`requireAdmin`)
- ✅ Backend middleware for authenticated users (`requireAuth`)
- ✅ Protected routes with proper authorization

### 3. **Frontend Integration** ✅
- ✅ Login and registration forms with validation
- ✅ JWT token storage in localStorage
- ✅ Protected route component with role checking
- ✅ Role-based navigation menu
- ✅ Admin dashboard protection

### 4. **Security Features** ✅
- ✅ Backend route protection (blogs, users)
- ✅ Frontend route protection (admin dashboard)
- ✅ Token expiration handling
- ✅ Role-based menu items
- ✅ Access denied pages for unauthorized users

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### **Backend Testing:**
1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test unprotected routes:**
   ```bash
   # Should work without authentication
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/blogs
   ```

3. **Test protected routes:**
   ```bash
   # Should fail without token
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/blogs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title":"Test","content":"Test content"}'
   
   # Should fail with regular user token
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

### **Frontend Testing:**
1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Frontend will be available at: **http://localhost:3002** (or 3001 if 3002 is busy)
   - Backend will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

2. **Test user registration:**
   - Go to **http://localhost:3002/create-account**
   - Register a new user
   - Should redirect to login page

3. **Test user login:**
   - Go to **http://localhost:3002/login**
   - Login with credentials
   - Should see role in navigation
   - Regular users should NOT see "Admin Dashboard" link

4. **Test admin dashboard protection:**
   - Try to access **http://localhost:3002/admin-dash** without login → Should redirect to login
   - Try to access **http://localhost:3002/admin-dash** as regular user → Should show "Access Denied"
   - Only admin users should see the dashboard

5. **Test navigation:**
   - Login as regular user → Should see "User" role, no admin link
   - Login as admin → Should see "Admin" role and admin dashboard link

## 🔐 **Security Features Implemented:**

### **Backend Security:**
- ✅ All user routes require authentication
- ✅ Admin-only routes require admin role
- ✅ Blog creation requires admin role
- ✅ JWT token validation on all protected routes

### **Frontend Security:**
- ✅ Admin dashboard protected with role checking
- ✅ Token expiration handling
- ✅ Automatic logout on token expiry
- ✅ Role-based navigation menu
- ✅ Access denied pages

## 🎉 **Completion Status: 100%**

All objectives have been fulfilled:
- ✅ JWT authentication implemented
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented
- ✅ Frontend-backend integration complete
- ✅ Page protection based on user roles
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities fixed
- ✅ No major bugs remaining

The authentication system is now production-ready with proper security measures!
